'''
This is a simple configuration files that will allow you to build a complete set
of VectorCAST projects automatically from the build settings gathered by vcShell
The following workflow should be used:
 
    - Copy this file and the other files located in: VECTORCAST_DIR/examples/AutomationController
    -     into the build directory root, or some other work directory
    - edit the constants at the top of this script to match your application
    - run the startAutomation.py file using the command: $VECTORCAST_DIR/vpython startAutomation.py
    -     (for windows, double click on the runShell.bat file to open a shell first)

# If you are building the VC project from existing VC/C++ environments, 
# you only need to setup the configuration variables in this first section.  
# If you are building from a VCShell database, then please review all 
# configuration variables.

### Project name is any ASCII string that is used by
### VectorCAST as the prefix the various projects
### Change this to something meaningful for your project
PROJECT_NAME=os.environ['EMUL']
VCAST_WORKAREA='vcast-workarea/' + PROJECT_NAME
VCDB_FILENAME=os.environ['VCDB_FILENAME']

### VectorCAST Compiler Tag
### Must be consistent with the compiler that was used to build the app.
### This variable can be set to 
###    a. A VectorCAST Compiler Tag: 'GNU_C_46'
###    b: The full path to an existing CFG file: /home/VC/CCAST_.CFG
VCAST_COMPILER_CONFIGURATION=os.getcwd() + '/code_coverage/support/master.CCAST_.CFG'


#######################################################################################
# The following set of options will take care of most normal use cases

### Project Limits (for first time use to make things faster)
### To test the configuration, we recommend using the default values of 1,1,0
### This will provide a FAST initial test of the build and build settings.
### If the first run works nicely and you get a VC project, bump the 
### numbers up to 50, 50, 5, for a second run, which will generate a cover 
### project with 50 files, 50 unit test environments and 5 fully built unit test environments.
### You can set these variables to 'max' or 'all' to process all files from the vcshell.db
### If you only want to do System Testing set MAXIMUM_FILES_TO_UNIT_TEST to 0
### If you only want to do Unit Testing, set MAXIMUM_FILES_TO_SYSTEM_TEST to 0
### MAXIMUM_FILES_TO_SYSTEM_TEST=0
MAXIMUM_FILES_TO_UNIT_TEST=0
MAXIMUM_UNIT_TESTS_TO_BUILD=0

### Specify the files to be prioritized when building the VectorCAST project
### If you specify ['foo.c', .bar.c', 'main.c'] these will be the first 3
### units processed.  If you specify a file limit of 2, we will process foo.c
### and bar.c in the rist invocation, and main.c next time
FILES_OF_INTEREST=[AutomationController.parameterNotSetString]

### FILES_OF_INTEREST=[s.strip() for s in open(PROJECT_NAME + "_filter.list","r").readlines()]

### VCShell DataBase Location
### The vcshell.db file should always be generated at the build area root directory
### (the place where you normally run the make command).  The default workflow is to run
### the Automation Controller scripts in that build area root directory, which results
### in the VectorCAST workarea (vcast-workarea) being generated there also.
### If you wish to run create the VectorCAST workarea in some other place, copy
### the automation controller files to that alternate location, and set VCSHELL_DB_LOCATION
### to point at location of the vcshell.db (the build area root)
### You must use an absolute path for this file (not relative)
VCSHELL_DB_LOCATION=os.getcwd()

### Code Coverage
### Choices are: none, statement, branch, mcdc, statement+branch, statement+mcdc, basis_paths, probe_point, coupling
VCAST_COVERAGE_TYPE='statement'

### This will construct the .env files with the path to the vcshell, rather than the search paths and unit options
### Change it to False if you wish to construct .env files with search paths and unit options
### Default value is True which uses ENVIRO.VCDB_FILENAME
ENV_FILES_USE_VCDB=True

### Instrument in place means that the original file foo.c is backed up
### to foo.c.vcast.bak, and an instrumented foo.c is stoed in its place
####INSTRUMENT_IN_PLACE=0

INSTRUMENT_IN_PLACE=True

### The VCDB_FLAG_STRING flags will be used as "extra" flags when we call vcdb
### to get the unit options.  If nothing is passed we will use the -I and -D flags only
### A common value for this for GNU is "-isystem=1"
VCAST_VCDB_FLAG_STRING='-iquote=1'

# This list of main files will be used to automatically append the c_cover_io.c file
# to one file in each application that is being instrumented.
# If you want VectorCAST to automatically compute the insert locations for c_cover_io:
LIST_OF_MAIN_FILES = [AutomationController.parameterNotSetString]
# If you want to manually choose the files where c_cover_io is inserted do this:
# LIST_OF_MAIN_FILES = ['firstMain.c', 'secondMain.c']
# To disable the insert of the c_cover_io.c completely, do this:
# LIST_OF_MAIN_FILES = []
LIST_OF_MAIN_FILES = ['70_inlines.c']


### You can optionally run Lint analysis on the files in the project
LINT=False

### This value will be used to set a TCAST_CASE_TIMEOUT option for the UnitTest node
### This is useful, especially for basis path tests that sometimes loop foreever.
### If you do not want to use a timeout value, set this variable to 0
TEST_TIMEOUT=10



#######################################################################################
# The follow set of configuration option supports advanced workflows

### When vcshell creates a settings database, it makes all of the -I paths that it finds
### VectorCAST search paths.  In some cases, you may want to over-ride this default behavior
### The INCLUDE_PATH_OVERRIDE feature allows you to exactly control how Include Paths 
### are handled by the automation controller.  The INCLUDE_PATH_OVERRIDE variable
### is a list of tuples which contain the include path and the OverRide Action.
### Possible OverRide Action values are: 
###             NONE:   Do not use this Include Path
###             SEARCH: Consider the path a Search Path (default)
###             LIB:    Consider the path a Library Include Path
###             TYPE:   Consider the path a Type Handled Path
### If the list contains a path that is not in the vcshell database, we will add that path
### INCLUDE_PATH_OVERRIDE = [('/home/mySourceCode/libDir', 'LIB'), ('/home/mySourceCode/newPath', 'SEARCH')
INCLUDE_PATH_OVERRIDE = []

### This filter function below can be used to limit the files that are processed.
### You can use the FILTER_PATTERNS objects with the default filterFiles 
### function, or you can completely replace the filterFiles function.
###
### The filter strings will OR'd and applied to the absolute file paths
### This allows you to filter down to a set or directories or files
### whose names contain any one of the strings.  For example, if you
### have a file structure like this: /home/source/subSystem1  
### /home/source/subSystem2, then the following filter pattern:
### FILTER_PATTERNS = ['/subSystem2', 'foo']  
### would yield all of the files in subSystem2, and any other file
### whose path contains the string foo.  MAXIMUM_FILES_TO_SYSTEM_TEST 
### and MAXIMUM_FILES_FOR_UNIT_TEST 
### still control the maximum number of files to be processed.
